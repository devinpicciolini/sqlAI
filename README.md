## OpenAI SQL Query Generator

This code allows you to use the OpenAI API to generate SQL queries based on a user's prompt and the structure of a table in a Google Sheet or a CSV file. The code uses the Pandas library to read and convert the data to a DataFrame.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/devinpicciolini/sqlAI.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install openai pandas gspread oauth2client
```


3. Replace the openai.api_key value in the code with your OpenAI API key. (https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)

4. Create a credentials.json file with your Google Sheets API credentials. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt_PtZ6KYIE)

5. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:
```
python openai_query_generator.py
```

6. The script will ask if you would like to use a Google Sheet or a local file as your data source.

7. If you choose a Google Sheet, enter the URL of the sheet and the name of the sheet.

8. If you choose a local file, enter the file path when prompted.

9. Enter your query prompt when prompted. The script will continue to prompt for queries until you exit the script.

10. The generated query will be displayed on the terminal.

### Security

- Remove any hardcoded sensitive information from the code, such as credentials or API keys.
